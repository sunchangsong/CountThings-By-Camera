## How to automated counting of bacterial colony in petri dish agar plates

​     Bacterial culture is a very important research method in medical treatment, animal husbandry, agriculture and forestry. Bacterial culture inevitably requires counting the number of bacteria. However, the commonly used counting method is very time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there are errors, and it is not easy to record.    

​    With the development of science and technology, artificial intelligence is becoming more and more advanced. It only needs a mobile phone to complete the work that took dozens of minutes to complete in tens of seconds. The efficiency is greatly improved. The error is small, the speed is fast, and the record is clear.

### Frist

​    Open the software, select the picture you need to count, or take a picture directly. The software has no requirements on the environment, as long as the picture is clear.
