## Automatically count bacterial colony forming unit - CountThings By Camera

  **Accurately counting bacterial colonies forms an integral part of a diverse range of experiments such as checking the safety of foods and pharmaceutical products as well as determining the efficacy of vaccines. With the assumption that each colony comes from a single microorganism, researchers dilute and plate the liquid culture directly onto agar plates, eventually determining the original microbial concentration by counting colony-forming units (CFUs) on each plate.**

  The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
