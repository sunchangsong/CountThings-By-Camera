## What is colony Automated counting method?

  Count how many bacterial colonies there are on each plate (the spots you see). There should be approximately **~ 75** bacterial colonies on the two (+) pGLO plates. The lawn of bacteria on the LB plate contains an even spread of bacteria and individual colonies can't be counted.

  The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
