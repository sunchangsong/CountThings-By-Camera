## How do you Automated  identify bacterial colonies in a Petri dish?

  A CFU is defined as **a single, viable propagule that produces a single colony (a population of the cells visible to the naked eye) on an appropriate semisolid growth medium**.

  The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
