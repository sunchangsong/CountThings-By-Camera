## Automated Counting colonies on agar plates

​    After incubating the plate under appropriate conditions for the microorganism, the colonies are counted. For the spread, pour, or drop methods, the colony counting is self-explanatory: **count each colony dot once**. A marker can be used pointing each counted colony on the back of the Petri dish.

​    The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
