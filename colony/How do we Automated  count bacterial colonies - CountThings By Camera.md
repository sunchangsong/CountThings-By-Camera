## How do we Automated  count bacterial colonies

  An easier and more accurate method to determine the microbial count is the **plate method, where a food sample is placed on a culture medium plate**. After an appropriate incubation period, you can count the number of colonies that have formed on the culture medium plate.

  But this way will lead to inaccurate count. The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
