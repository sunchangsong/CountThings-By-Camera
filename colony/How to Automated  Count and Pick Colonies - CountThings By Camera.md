## How to Automated  Count and Pick Colonies

​    Counting the number of colonies that arise on a pour plate can calculate the concentration by **multiplying the count by the volume spread on the pour plate**. Direct counting methods are easy to perform and do not require highly specialized equipment, but are often slower than other methods.

​    The colony counting problem can be easily solved by using the "CountThings By Camera" mobile app. You only need to take a photo, click to identify, and the whole process can be automatically completed, and the accuracy can also be adjusted.
